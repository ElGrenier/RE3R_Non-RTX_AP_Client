# RE3R AP Client
Archipelago randomizer client for Resident Evil 3 Remake, designed to work with the RE3R apworld here: https://github.com/dontjoome/RE3R_AP_World

## IMPORTANT / READ FIRST

- Use teleports sparingly
- Do not switch save files, or you may lose items.
- Save often. Save after boss fights.
- When you complete a randomizer, restart your game before starting another one.

## Install Steps

1. **THIS ONLY WORKS WITH THE non-RTX BETA OF RE3R ON STEAM. TO SWITCH, RIGHT-CLICK RE3R AND OPEN PROPERTIES:**
![non-rtx-RE3R](https://github.com/dontjoome/RE3R_AP_Client/assets/63137482/ddbeea99-7217-4276-a3fb-9bf0c292d386)
2. Download REFramework from the most recent release here: https://github.com/praydog/REFramework/releases
    - Get the RE3_TDB67 zip.
3. Extract the REFramework zip in your RE3 game folder (Steam or otherwise)
    - Once you've done this, you should have an reframework folder in your game folder, and it should've added a dinput8.dll to the game folder.
4. Download the source for this client, extract that zip somewhere, and copy both the "reframework" folder and the lua-apclientpp.dll file into your game folder.
    - It may ask to overwrite or merge on the "reframework" folder, just click Yes.
5. That's it! Start the game and enjoy!
